## Questions and Answers on Crowdfunding Report

### 1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

> -	Arts based campaigns like film & video, music, and theatre are the most popular to start campaigns for. This is a conjecture, but I believe its because of the low >funding available in those fields.
> -	By subcategory, Plays make up most fundraising projects as a whole and in every individual country. Please see my previous conjecture for my thoughts.
> -	Overall, Technology seems to be more popular for individuals to fund leaving a higher success rate. By subcategory, Web projects seem to have the highest success >rate. My conjecture is that web projects take a minimal amount of capital to get started.
>-	Films and Videos have a high success to failure ratio in August. Causation is not established; different projects have different period lengths of fundraising.
>-	Success does have a relationship with the goal set at the beginning. It is not causation, but starting at 15000, there is a higher success rate. My hypothesis is >that these more expensive projects are more put together and have more money put into their marketing and SEO optimization. The sample size is small so a larger >sample may disprove this. >=50000, there may not be enough people that have interest to fund these more expensive endeavors.

### 2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

>This sample is not labeled as random samples so it may not be reflective of the population of total campaigns. 1000 is a large sample size, but when breaking down the >sample into categories and subcategories, journalism has a sample of 4 which is not significant and shows a 100% success rate which is not reflective of reality. By >country, some samples are small; this may be reflective of funding campaign country of origin ratios but having such a small sample of certain individual countries >make their specific part of the data set less likely to reflect reality.

### 3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

>A combo chart showing the cost relationship to the category and subcategory may show us why more expensive projects have success rates higher than cheaper projects. >It may show a correlation between the categories and cost and the success patterns between them. Doughnut charts may better show the ratios and percentages in a >visual manner. A combination bar chart would alleviate the problem of needing to switch between looking at success rations and ratio of the category to the full >sample size.

### Bonus 1. Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

>From observing the data, when a funding campaign succeeds, there is a large variance of excess fundraising. The maximum exceeding of the goal for successful campaigns >is 2339%. These outliers make the average not meaningful when it comes to being a summary of the data. The median better explains the data by giving a better picture >of the more common outcomes of these campaigns. Most projects are not going to be expensive projects, most outcomes are only going to be failing by half or successful >by a margin above the goal that wonâ€™t exceed too much more than double.

### Bonus 2. Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
>There is more variance in successful campaigns. There is no cap to excess past the goal. This increases variance when a project meets for example, 2000% of their >goal. Failed projects will only range from 0-99%.
