# Croudfunding Project Sample Analysis in Excel

> using Excel to visualize crowdfunding data and analyze success rates in different catagories and years.

## Step 1

> New columns and initial visualizations.

| Sub Step | Description |
|--------------|---------------|
| Outcome | use conditional formatting to visualize outcome of a project. ie success, fail, cancelled, etc |
| Percent Funded | create a column to show a percentage ratio of pledged to goal. Visualize rate of success though conditional formatting |
| Average Donation | create a column to calculate average donation per backer |
| Category and Sub-Category | use split function to make two columns; one with category only, one with sub-category only |

## Step 2

> Pivot tables and stats

| Sub Step | Description |
|--------------|---------------|
| Category | create pivot table that counted outcomes per category |
| Sub-category | create pivot table that counted outcomes per sub-category with parent category and country filters |
| Timelines | convert Unix timestamps of launch and deadline into normal dates. stored dates in new columns |
| Launch date outcomes | create pivot table that counts outcome based on date created with parent category and years filters |

*see CrowdfundingReport.md for analysis and questions about query.*

## Step 3

> Outcomes based on goals

| Sub Step | Description |
|--------------|---------------|
| Columns | create * `Goal`  * `Number Successful`  * `Number Failed`  * `Number Canceled`  * `Total Projects`  * `Percentage Successful`  * `Percentage Failed`  * `Percentage Canceled` columns |
| Organization | create rows to categorize project samples based on goals set in ~5000 dollar increments |
| Data Population and Analysis | using 'COUNTIFS()' formula to populate columns with sample data. create line chart to visualize relationship |
| Evaluation of statistics | calculate   * The mean number of backers  * The median number of backers  * The minimum number of backers  * The maximum number of backers  * The variance of the number of backers  * The standard deviation of the number of backers * to determine which statistic most meaningfully summarizes sample |
| Varience | evaluate differences in varience between outcomes and infer a relationship |

*see CrowdfundingReport.md for analysis and questions about query.*
